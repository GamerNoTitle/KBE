Extract the keyboard input from wireshark datapack

As we all know that wireshark can capture the keyboard input and store it in `pcapng` file. You can find them in every `usb.capdata` attribute.

This script can help you extract the keyboard input and restore them into the key. 

**CAUTION: The result that restored by this script sometimes may not be the `$flag`, it may also encrypted by other way.**
